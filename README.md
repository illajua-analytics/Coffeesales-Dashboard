# Coffee-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)

## Project Objective
☕ Built an interactive sales dashboard for a coffee company to analyze yearly performance (2019–2022) of Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa across the USA, UK, and Ireland. Highlights top-selling coffee types and provides insights to support data-driven business strategies.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/illajua-analytics/Coffeesales-Dashboard/blob/main/Coffee-Sales%20(2019-2022).xlsx">Dataset</a>

## General KPIs

What is the total sales revenue over time?

Which country or region generated the most sales?

When are the peak sales months or seasons?

Which coffee type is contributing maximum to the sales?

Do Loyalty cards/subscriptions increase the sales of coffee ?

## Process
Verified the dataset for missing values and anomalies, and performed necessary data cleaning.
Ensured data consistency in terms of data types, formats, and standardized values.
Created pivot tables based on key business questions to extract insights.
Integrated all pivot tables into a single interactive dashboard with slicers for dynamic filtering.

## Project Insights

Sales remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2021, with total revenue across all coffee types peaking at $13,766.11 in 2021. However, there was a significant decline in 2022, with revenue dropping to a four-year low of $7,063.44—indicating a potential shift in consumer behavior or market conditions.

The United States generated the highest total revenue at $35,638.89, outperforming the UK and Ireland by $26,143.52. However, based on FAOSTAT data, Ireland has the highest per-capita coffee consumption at 7.77 kg in 2021, surpassing both the US and UK. This suggests that expanding marketing efforts in Ireland could significantly boost future revenue potential.
Based on the data, there is no clear seasonal pattern in monthly coffee sales. However, 2021 recorded the three highest monthly sales compared to other years, indicating a strong overall performance. Notably, August consistently had the lowest sales in both 2021 and 2022. To address this dip, the company could implement targeted marketing campaigns or promotional offers specifically in August to boost demand. Additionally, further analysis of the strategies used in 2021 may reveal actionable insights that can be replicated to drive future growth.

The dashboard clearly highlights Arabica coffee as the top revenue-generating product, particularly in the United States. This aligns with global consumer trends, as Arabica is widely recognized as the most popular coffee variety worldwide (Perini da Silva et al., 2024), suggesting strong alignment between product performance and market preference.

The data indicates that non-loyalty card holders still generate higher total revenue across all countries, with the exception of Ireland, where loyalty card users contributed an additional $336.91 in revenue. While the impact on overall sales is not yet significant, loyalty programs may still play a key role in customer retention and purchase consistency over time. According to McKinsey & Company, top-performing loyalty programs can increase revenue by 15–25% annually, primarily by boosting purchase frequency, basket size, or both. This suggests potential for long-term gains if the program is optimized and targeted effectively.

## Final Conclusion

The analysis reveals key trends and opportunities for the company’s coffee sales performance between 2019 and 2022. While overall revenue remained stable through 2021—with a peak of $13,766.11—a sharp decline in 2022 suggests a potential shift in market behavior or operational gaps. The United States leads in total revenue, yet Ireland’s high per-capita coffee consumption points to an underutilized market with strong growth potential, especially if supported by targeted marketing efforts.

Arabica coffee consistently outperformed all other types, particularly in the U.S., aligning with global consumer preferences. Meanwhile, August sales repeatedly underperformed, signaling a need for seasonal marketing campaigns or promotional strategies to counter this dip.

The role of loyalty cards remains mixed: although overall revenue is still higher among non-members, Ireland showed a modest revenue boost among loyalty card users. With global benchmarks showing up to 25% revenue uplift from well-managed loyalty programs, this is an area worth optimizing further.

However, it is important to note that gaps in the dataset—particularly missing months—present an incomplete picture of company performance. These data limitations hinder a fully accurate assessment of seasonal trends and customer behavior. To enable more informed decision-making, improving the consistency and completeness of data collection should be a priority moving forward..
